# Environment Package

Support package with common shared functionality, extending Laravel classes and providing buffer between application and subscribo packages code and framework.
Might plainly extend Laravel framework classes


## 1. Installation

1.1 Add the following to your project's composer.json:

1.1.1 Repository containing this package (note: you need to have access to this repository as well as to resources it points to)

1.1.2 Dependency under "require" key

```json
    "subscribo/support": "@dev"
```

If used with package adding this dependency for you, this step (1.1.2) is not necessary.
